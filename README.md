# Web-Crawler
Crawler e-commerce using requests and beautiful soup

Crawling is an art rather than a software.

Things to keep in mind before crawling:
1. Respect the "robots.txt"
2. Hit the site with smaller number of requests.
3. Give sufficient delay between successive requests.
4. Use rotating user agents whereever possible.


The program is meant to extract reviews from many pages of a single product.
It can be used for any product in walmart.
